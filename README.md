## Overview

Depth maps encode the distance of each pixel from a camera, making them essential in fields like computer vision, 3D scanning, and photogrammetry. However, turning these maps into 3D surfaces often requires significant effort and expertise. Depthify streamlines this process within Blender, enabling both professionals and enthusiasts to create detailed 3D surfaces quickly.

Depthify is ideal for:
- Converting depth maps into 3D models.
- Adding fine details to existing models.
- Creating custom terrains or abstract art.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Adaptive Subdivision and Displacement:** Automatically adjusts the mesh density to enhance surface detail based on the depth map.
- **Material Integration:** Apply separate image files for material diffusion, enabling realistic texturing alongside displacement.
- **Custom Depth Scaling:** Fine-tune the intensity of displacement to match artistic or project requirements.
- **Depth Map Inversion:** Automatically correct inverted depth maps to ensure accurate surface generation.

### Workflow Enhancements
- **Automatic Mesh Optimization:** Ensures the 3D model remains efficient without unnecessary polygon overhead.
- **Seamless Material Setup:** Simplifies the application of complex materials by combining color and depth maps directly within the addon.
- **Batch Processing:** Allows for the processing of multiple depth maps in one session, saving time on larger projects.

### Output Options
- **Customizable Rendering:** Output high-quality images or 3D models with adjustable anti-aliasing, format options (PNG, JPEG, etc.), and resolution settings.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `depthify.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/microsoft-bing-search-assistant/depthify/releases).
2. Open Blender and navigate to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.
3. Click on Install, select the `depthify.zip` file, and enable the addon.

## Usage

1. In the 3D viewport, select an object or create a new plane.
2. Navigate to Object Properties > Depthify panel.
3. Choose a depth map image and adjust the options as needed (e.g., depth scale, inversion).
4. Select a material image for diffusion (optional).
5. Click "Apply" to generate the 3D surface.
6. Render your scene or export the model for further use.

## Best Practices

- **High-Resolution Depth Maps:** Use high-quality depth maps for more accurate and detailed 3D surfaces.
- **Adjust Depth Scale:** Fine-tune the depth scale to avoid over-exaggerated or flattened surfaces.
- **Efficient Rendering:** Consider disabling unnecessary features like anti-aliasing for quick previews.

## Use Cases

- **3D Model Generation:** Convert depth maps from photos or scans into 3D objects.
- **Terrain Creation:** Use real or generated depth maps to create natural landscapes.
- **Artistic Effects:** Apply abstract depth maps to create unique visual effects in your 3D projects.

## Future Enhancements

- **AI-Powered Depth Map Generation:** Integrate with state-of-the-art models like Meta's SAM v2 for auto-generating depth maps from 2D images.
- **Improved Mesh Decimation:** Automatically optimize mesh density further based on the complexity of the depth map.
- **Texture Baking:** Allow users to bake materials and textures directly onto the generated 3D models.

## Acknowledgements

Depthify was developed with inspiration from:
- The [Blender Manual](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/materials/components/displacement.html) on displacement and adaptive subdivision.
- Python best practices from [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) and other resources.
- The Blender developer community's ongoing work on improving displacement and mesh handling.
